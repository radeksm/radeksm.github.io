# Why? #
1. I like physics.
1. I bought SOEKS geiger counter.
1. My curiosity.


# Natural radiation sources #
There are few natural radiation sources around us which sometimes may
be even a little bit surprising for you. Using my geiger counter
I made few measurments which I thought could be interesting to share.

## Natural background radiation at the ground level ##
 1. At the ground level in Kraków, Poland.

    Altitude 283m, radiation level range 0.60-0.20 [μSv/h].

 1. On the plane somewhere over Polish and Czech Republic border, flight LH 1627, Airbus A319.

    Altitude 9420m, radiation level 1.50-1.70 [μSv/h].

 1. On the plane somewhere over Atlantic, flight LH 480.

    Altitude a little bit over 11000m. Radiation 2.20-2.80 [μSv/h].
